**Tic Tac Toe** is one of the simplest yet most entertaining games to build when you're learning to code. In this blog, I'll guide you through creating a **Tic Tac Toe game in Angular**, demonstrating the fundamentals of component-based architecture and reactive programming.

### Why Angular for Games?

Angular is a powerful framework for building interactive and dynamic web applications. Its component-based structure and robust state management make it an excellent choice for small games like Tic Tac Toe.

---

### Key Features of the Game

1. **Dynamic Game Board**: A 3x3 grid representing the game board.
2. **Turn-Based Play**: Players take turns as `X` and `O`.
3. **Winner Detection**: Checks for winning conditions or a draw.
4. **Reset Functionality**: Allows players to restart the game.

---

### Step-by-Step Implementation

#### 1. Set Up Your Angular App

Start by creating a new Angular project:

```bash
ng new tic-tac-toe
cd tic-tac-toe
```

#### 2. In `app.component.html` file, replace the content with the following code

```html
<div class="game">
  <h1>Tic Tac Toe</h1>
  <div class="board">
    @for (cell of board; track $index) {
    <div class="cell" (click)="makeMove($index)">
      {{ cell }}
    </div>
    }
  </div>
  @if (winner) {
  <p>{{ winner }} wins!</p>
  <button (click)="resetGame()">Play Again</button>
  }
</div>
```

#### 4. Style the Game Board

Add these styles in `game.component.css`:

```css
.game {
  text-align: center;
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}

.board {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 100px);
  grid-gap: 5px;
  justify-content: center;
  margin: 20px auto;
}

.cell {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  font-size: 2rem;
  border: 1px solid #000;
  cursor: pointer;
}

.cell:hover {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
}

button {
  font-size: 1rem;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  margin: 20px 0;
  background-color: #007bff;
  color: #fff;
  border: none;
  cursor: pointer;
  border-radius: 5px;

  &:hover {
    background-color: #0056b3;
  }
}
```

---

#### 5. Implement the Game Logic in `app.component.ts`

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  imports: [],
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrl: './app.component.scss',
})
export class AppComponent {
  board: string[] = Array(9).fill('');
  currentPlayer: string = 'X';
  winner: string | null = null;

  makeMove(index: number) {
    if (!this.board[index] && !this.winner) {
      this.board[index] = this.currentPlayer;
      if (this.checkWinner()) {
        this.winner = this.currentPlayer;
      } else {
        this.currentPlayer = this.currentPlayer === 'X' ? 'O' : 'X';
      }
    }
  }

  checkWinner(): boolean {
    const winningCombinations = [
      [0, 1, 2],
      [3, 4, 5],
      [6, 7, 8],
      [0, 3, 6],
      [1, 4, 7],
      [2, 5, 8],
      [0, 4, 8],
      [2, 4, 6],
    ];

    return winningCombinations.some((combination) => {
      const [a, b, c] = combination;
      return (
        this.board[a] &&
        this.board[a] === this.board[b] &&
        this.board[a] === this.board[c]
      );
    });
  }

  resetGame() {
    this.board = Array(9).fill('');
    this.currentPlayer = 'X';
    this.winner = null;
  }
}
```

### 6. Run the App

To see your game in action, start the development server:

```bash
ng serve
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200` to play!

---

### Possible Enhancements

- **Scoreboard**: Keep track of wins for both players.
- **AI Opponent**: Implement a single-player mode with basic AI.
- **Mobile-Friendly Design**: Enhance the UI for smaller screens.

---

### Conclusion

With just a few lines of code, youâ€™ve built a fully functional Tic Tac Toe game in Angular! This project demonstrates the power of Angularâ€™s data binding, state management, and reusable components.

Now that youâ€™ve mastered the basics, try enhancing the game further and share your creation with others!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
